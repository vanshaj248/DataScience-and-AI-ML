# API Data Collection and Analysis

## Weather API Project

This project collects data from an online weather API and updates it to a CSV file. The main tasks include:

- Fetching weather data from the API.
- Parsing the received data.
- Storing the parsed data into a CSV file for further analysis.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.
2. **Configure API Access**: Set up your API key and endpoint.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to collect and store the data.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `pandas` library

### Example Usage

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Fetch data from the API
response = requests.get('YOUR_API_ENDPOINT')
data = response.json()

# Parse and store data in a CSV file
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('weather_data.csv', index=False)
```

### Notes

- A public api is used.
- Handle exceptions and errors for robust data collection.
- Schedule the script to run at regular intervals for continuous data collection.
