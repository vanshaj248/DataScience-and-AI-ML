# API Data Collection and Analysis

## Weather API Project

This project collects data from an online weather API and updates it to a CSV file. The main tasks include:

- Fetching weather data from the API.
- Parsing the received data.
- Storing the parsed data into a CSV file for further analysis.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.
2. **Configure API Access**: Set up your API key and endpoint.
3. **Run the Script**: The script is automatically executed every 2 hours using GitHub Actions to collect and store the data.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/data_collection.yml` file with the following content to automate the script execution.

### Notes

- A public API is used.
- Handle exceptions and errors for robust data collection.
- The script is scheduled to run every 2 hours using GitHub Actions for continuous data collection.

### ML Model

Once the data is collected and stored in the CSV file, it will be used to train machine learning models to predict future weather conditions. The steps involved are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features that will help improve the model's performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected models using the preprocessed data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to determine their accuracy and performance.
6. **Prediction**: Use the best-performing model to make predictions on future weather data.

### Steps to Train the ML Model

1. **Load Data**: Load the CSV data into your ML environment.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform any necessary transformations.
3. **Train Models**: Use libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to train your models.
4. **Evaluate Models**: Compare the performance of different models and select the best one.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict future weather conditions.

### Libraries and Tools

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
