# Types of Famous APIs and How to Build Them

## 1. REST API

### Overview

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP.

### How to Build

1. **Choose a framework**: Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), Spring Boot (Java), etc.
2. **Define endpoints**: Use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
3. **Implement CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
4. **Test your API**: Use tools like Postman or curl.

## 2. GraphQL API

### Overview :-

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.

### How to Build :-

1. **Choose a server**: Apollo Server (Node.js), Graphene (Python), etc.
2. **Define your schema**: Types, queries, and mutations.
3. **Resolve functions**: Map your schema to your data.
4. **Test your API**: Use GraphiQL or Apollo Client.

## 3. SOAP API

### Overview ;-

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services.

### How to Build ;-

1. **Choose a toolkit**: Apache CXF (Java), Zeep (Python), etc.
2. **Define WSDL**: Web Services Description Language file.
3. **Implement service methods**: Based on the WSDL.
4. **Test your API**: Use SOAP UI or similar tools.

## 4. gRPC API

### Overview -

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework initially developed by Google.

### How to Build -

1. **Define your service**: Use Protocol Buffers (protobuf).
2. **Generate code**: Use the protoc compiler.
3. **Implement server and client**: Based on the generated code.
4. **Test your API**: Use gRPC tools or custom scripts.

## Conclusion

Each type of API has its own use cases and advantages. Choose the one that best fits your needs and follow the steps to build and test it.
