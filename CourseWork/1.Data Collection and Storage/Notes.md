Awesome question—picking the right data storage depends on the job you’re doing. Here’s a clear, practical map from each quant task to storage options that fit best, plus quick definitions in simple words.

⸻

Quick definitions (super short)
	•	RDBMS: Relational database (tables/SQL). Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL.
	•	Time-series DB: Optimized for timestamped data (prices, ticks). Examples: kdb+, TimescaleDB.
	•	Columnar store: Saves data by columns for fast analytics. Examples: Parquet files, ClickHouse.
	•	Object storage: Cheap “big folder in the cloud/disk” for files. Examples: S3, MinIO, local disk.
	•	Cache: Super-fast temporary storage. Example: Redis.
	•	Data lake: Big collection of files (often Parquet) + metadata. Example: S3 + Parquet.
	•	Warehouse/OLAP: Analytics database for big queries. Examples: Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse.
	•	Streaming: Pipe for real-time data. Example: Kafka.
	•	Graph DB: Stores entities + relationships as a graph. Example: Neo4j.

Best-fit storage by use case

| Use Case                        | What You Store                                    | Best Storage Choices                                                    | Why These Work Well                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quant hedge fund strategies      | Historical prices, features, signals, PnL         | Parquet files in a data lake (S3/MinIO/local), DuckDB/ClickHouse, Redis | Parquet is cheap and portable; DuckDB/ClickHouse are fast for analytics; Redis is instant for live data. |
| Portfolio optimisation           | Factor returns, covariances, constraints, holdings| PostgreSQL for positions/constraints, Parquet for matrices, Data warehouse| SQL tables for transactions; Parquet for large numeric arrays; warehouse for fast slicing.           |
| Risk management & analysis       | Positions, exposures, VaR scenarios, stress paths | PostgreSQL for records, Parquet for scenarios, Data warehouse           | SQL for audit trail; Parquet for big scenario sets; warehouse for heavy reporting.                   |
| Derivatives pricing & structuring| Vol surfaces, curves, trade parameters, quotes    | Parquet for history, Redis for latest quotes, PostgreSQL for trades      | Parquet for historical data; Redis for real-time quotes; SQL for trade metadata.                     |
| Algo execution & trading         | Tick/LOB data, orders, fills, latencies           | Time-series DB (kdb+, QuestDB, TimescaleDB), Redis, Kafka               | Time-series DBs handle ticks; Redis keeps order books fast; Kafka for real-time streams.             |
| Quant research & alpha           | Alt-data, features, experiment results            | Parquet data lake, DuckDB, ML feature store (optional)                  | Parquet is cheap and versionable; DuckDB for SQL on files; feature store for ML workflows.           |
| Data analytics & alternative data| Logs, web-scrapes, text/semi-structured data      | Object storage (JSON/CSV/Parquet), Data warehouse                       | Store raw data cheaply; transform to columnar for analytics.                                        |
| ESG quantitative strategies      | Company links, scores, text, supply chains        | Graph DB (Neo4j), Document store (MongoDB), Parquet                     | Graph DB for relationships; document store for text; Parquet for scored panels and modeling.         |


⸻

Minimal, “works-on-a-Mac” stack (great for you right now)
	•	History & research: Parquet files on disk + DuckDB (SQL directly on Parquet).
	•	Relational bits (positions, trades, metadata): PostgreSQL (or SQLite if solo/offline).
	•	Real-time cache: Redis (for latest prices/signals).
	•	Time-series (if you start doing ticks): TimescaleDB (Postgres extension) or QuestDB.
	•	Streaming (later): Kafka (only if you actually need real-time pipelines).

If you want ultra-simple: Parquet + DuckDB + SQLite will take you very far for learning, backtests, and prototypes.

⸻

File formats to standardize on
	•	Parquet (columnar, compressed): best default for analytics and ML.
	•	Arrow/Feather: fast local interchange with Python/R.
	•	HDF5: good for big arrays (e.g., scenario cubes), but Parquet often wins for ecosystem support.
	•	CSV/JSON: only at the raw/landing stage; convert to Parquet ASAP.

⸻

Versioning & governance (light but important)
	•	lakeFS or DVC: “git for data” (track versions of Parquet).
	•	Great Expectations: data quality checks.
	•	Data catalog (lightweight): even a README + schema + owner + refresh frequency per dataset helps a lot.

⸻

Simple starter blueprint (you can implement today)
	1.	Store historical market data as Parquet (one file per symbol per day/month).
	2.	Query with DuckDB (fast SQL on Parquet) for backtests.
	3.	Keep positions/trades in Postgres (or SQLite at start).
	4.	Cache latest prices/signals in Redis during live sim.
	5.	For ESG experiments, keep relationship data in Neo4j (optional now; add when needed).
